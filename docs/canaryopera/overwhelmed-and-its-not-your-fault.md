The consensus among nearly 250 scientists studying the subject is that five emotions can be considered universal, in the sense that all humans experience them, regardless of culture: Anger, Fear, Sadness, Disgust, and Enjoyment.

> Stress, one of the major causes of psychiatric disease, is a physiological, physical, and emotional response to an external or internal stimulus such as social pressure, life-threatening experiences, or any of numerous diseases [2]. It can initiate further mental health problems such as depression, loss of confidence, and apathy, among others [2], [3]. Cortisol is a well-known biomarker of psychological stress [3], [4], [5].
